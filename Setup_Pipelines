1. Set up a Premium Workspace using the following naming convention: YourInitials_PipelinesBC (e.g. CT_PipelinesBC) on the embedded capacity: pbipremiumexperimentalcapacity
2. Create a deployment pipeline with the same name naming convention (YourInitials_PipelinesBC)
3. Assign the dev workspace to the corresponding environment.
4. Publish the sample report to the dev workspace.
5. Deploy the report and dataset to Test and refresh the data. You probably have to authenticate against the source with basic authentication. We have the credentials for you in the slides shown.
6. Open the report and check if the data is available. 

Question: Which country is shown? 
Please provide your answer in the poll in teams. The poll is anonymous. (In this way, we sneakily check how far everyone is)

The imaginary users have tested the report.. and sadly, we have loaded too much data. Therefore we will reduce the data in the dataset to meet the requirements of the users.

7. Open the sample report and go to the query editor.
8. Change the daterange of the sales table to 2 years with the code:
Table.SelectRows(#"Removed Columns", each Date.IsInPreviousNYears([Date], 2))

9. Close and Apply
10. Publish the report to Dev 

The report with the adjusted dataset is available on Dev but not on the Test. You will see that the sales are lower in our dataset on Dev because there are only two years of data in the dataset instead of six. This is exactly what the users wanted. Our users test the data on the Test, so we deploy the report and dataset to test to make sure the users can test our new dataset and report.

11. Publish changes to Test and refresh the dataset. If you do not refresh the data, the applied changes will not be shown, as the deployment pipeline only deploys the metadata. It doesn’t deploy the data itself.

The users are happy with the report, we can deploy to production now, whoop whoop!

12. Deploy everything to production and set the credentials of the source again (basic authentication and same credentials), and refresh the dataset.

The next step is to switch the source of the dataset. We have used test data so far, but it’s important that we show production data in production. We would like to switch the data source in production automatically so the production dataset and report actually contain production data. We can do this with the help of the deployment rule.

13. Change the Datasource of the dataset with the use of deployment rules of the production workspace, as shown in the demo. This source is called: CanadaSales

14. Deploy the dataset and report from the Test again to production, otherwise, the deployment rule will not be applied.
15. Don’t forget to refresh the dataset!! Otherwise, the report will still show the test data, and that’s definitely not what we want. 

Question: What is the amount of sales shown?
